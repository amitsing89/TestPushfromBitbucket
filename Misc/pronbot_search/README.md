# pronbot_search
Searches for pronbots by looking at followers/following

This is a bunch of tools I created on the weekend of 10th March 2018 to find pr0nbots. I devised this search method after a series of said bots liked a tweet I was mentioned in. They all shared similar descriptions, and hence it was easy to identify them. In the end I found about 22,000 bots before terminating the script. At the time of termination, it had only iterated through about 4000 accounts.
